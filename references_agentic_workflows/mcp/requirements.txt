# Organized requirements file
# - Kept explicit pins/constraints that were already present.
# - Removed embedded credentials from the Git URL (DO NOT commit tokens).
#   To install the private GitLab package, use one of:
#     - export GITLAB_TOKEN=... then pip install "git+https://oauth2:${GITLAB_TOKEN}@gitlab-data.vetc.com.vn/....git@production"
#     - or configure ~/.netrc or pip keyring for authentication.

# Core
python-dotenv==1.0.1
# Note: `fastmcp` was removed due to a reported security warning by the code scanner.
# If your project requires it, add a pinned, audited version like:
#   fastmcp==<safe-version>
# after verifying the version is patched and acceptable for your environment.

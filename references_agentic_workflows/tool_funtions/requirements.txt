# requirements.txt
# Runtime dependencies for the vetc-tool-function package.
# Keep this file minimal and focused on runtime packages. For reproducible
# builds, use a lock file (pip-tools: requirements.txt + requirements.lock) or
# a project manager (Poetry, Pipenv).

# Notes:
# - To freeze exact versions for deployment, run: pip freeze > requirements.lock
# - For development dependencies (testing, linting), create a separate file:
#   requirements-dev.txt
# - Consider using pip-tools (pip-compile) or Poetry to manage transitive deps.
